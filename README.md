# Farcaster Frame Constructed with Remix

This Farcaster frame is developed using Remix (with Vite) and is prepared for deployment on Cloudflare.

To test the frame, visit https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames and specify the frame URL as https://remix-frames.pages.dev/frame.

For a simple UI, you can also access it at https://remix-frames.pages.dev.

ðŸš¨ If you intend to deploy this repository to your Cloudflare account, establish a KV binding as outlined here: https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite#bindings.
